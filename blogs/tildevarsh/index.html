A few days ago some people at gnulinuxindia.org online chatroom talked about making some tilde based on tilde.club or something. I didn't exactly know what it meant or how it worked so just joined them and submitted the form <a href="https://tildevarsh.in/register">here</a> I didn't know how ssh keys worked so just watched a youtube tutorial to figure it out lol.
<br>
In case you don't know it too just open up your linux terminal and follow the steps ahead.

<pre><code>
ssh-keygen
</code></pre>
<p class="flex mono">You will see the following text:
</p>
<pre><code>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.<br>
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):<br>
</code></pre>
<p class="flex mono">
Press enter to save your keys to the default /home/username/.ssh directory.<br>
Then you'll be prompted to enter a password:<br>
</p>
<pre><code>
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
</code></pre>
<p class="flex mono">
just type a passphrase(something you don't forget)<br>
after confirming you will see a art and some text.<br>
Now copy and paste the contents of /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the public key field in the form.
<br>
done with my submission I then waited a day and finally today was able to ssh into the server and wrote my public_html files.
copied css from this website removing the bloat a bareminimum.
You can check my tilde at <a href="https://arian.tildevarsh.in/">~arian</a><br>
Tilde website https://tildevarsh.in the tilde is for like minded unix-like systems users from India so if you are one come join us.

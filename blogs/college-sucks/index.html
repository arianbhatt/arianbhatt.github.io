<p>Today didn’t really start of well I had a mild headache but for
whatever reason decided to go to college. and oh boy was it bad Today I
attended first cs class this semester about Data Stuctures and
Algorithms with C++ and I hated the class. Will most probably have to
learn it myself. The Maths class was usual nothing much well I didn’t
pay attention as I had headache lol. The Physics class got canceled so
that’s nice I guess. Going Home by Bus is tiring but well it does the
job. Hopefully Tommorow will be better and No this isn’t going to be a
daily blog it’s just today I wanted to write somewhere. Will most
probably Put my Data Structures Notes on my website will be helful to
fill up the website. <br>Here have a Flower I found at my college.</p>
